# Facial-Recognition-with-mask-using-CNN


# 	OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The objectives of our project are :
 • To create a face images with mask (dataset).
 • To develop a custom deep learning model to recognize a face with mask.
The scope of this work is to implement the attendance system through face recognition. In any sector, attendance of staff members is very important. In other fields like passport checking, ATM, credit card, voter verification, smart door, criminal or terrorist investigation and many other purposes face recognition is widely used to authenticate a person automatically and accurately. For those reasons, face recognition is the most popular than any other Biometric techniques. This application is more efficient and easy for current pandemic situation.
